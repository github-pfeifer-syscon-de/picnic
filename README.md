# picnic

A picture viewer allows you to flip true your images by using OpenGL, and thumbnail services and Dbus.


![Picnic](picnic.png "picnic")

![PicnicWin](picview.png "picnic view window")

Build with autotools, requires genericGlm (see there for some basic build infos).

By no means that is intended to be complete, or help you to go true anything more than a hundred pictures.

Enjoy it, you may inprove it, or leave it.
